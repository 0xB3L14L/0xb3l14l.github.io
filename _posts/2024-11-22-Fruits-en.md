First, a scan is performed to detect the active ports.
![nmap1](/Media/Images/Fruits/fruits-nmap1.png)

It only shows two active ports, 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP).

Now, knowing which ports are active, we can check the version of the SSH and HTTP services, and we can also use the default nmap scripts.

If you go to the website, you can find a search option.

But it doesn't show anything useful.

From here, you can perform a search for directories and files using the tool `gobuster`.

A file named "fruits.php" is found; since its extension is php, we can test if it is vulnerable to LFI (Local File Inclusion). To do this, we need to fuzz to find the name of the search parameter.

The tool `wfuzz` can be used to search for /etc/passwd, and if necessary, path traversal can be applied.

The parameter is called "file," and it is not necessary to use path traversal.

Looking at the file, there is a user named "bananaman." Since the SSH service is enabled, I tried to find the user's id_rsa file, but I had no luck. However, now that I have the user, I can attempt a brute force attack with `hydra`

And the password is "celtic"

Once inside the machine, the command `find` can be executed as SUDO. Then, using [GTFOBINS](https://gtfobins.github.io/) to see a way to escalate privileges.

Now we are root on the **Fruits** machine.
