Hello everyone.

I am a cybersecurity student with a great passion for the offensive side with the goal of becoming a pentester and belonging to a Red Team, with my main interests being red teaming, malware analysis, and development.

The objective of this blog is to consolidate my knowledge. I am not an expert or an experienced programmer, as I am just starting out, but I want to learn and improve. By posting on the blog, I hope to further solidify what I learn, as one of the best ways to learn is through teaching.

In this blog, you will find diverse content on cybersecurity. I will not only focus on solving CTFs (Red and Blue), but also on malware development, the tactics and techniques used, and how to analyze it. Additionally, I will explain concepts and create practical labs.

>Disclaimer:
All content present (and future) in this blog, including techniques, proof of concepts, programs, etc., is for educational purposes only. I do not endorse or support the use of this content for malicious purposes. My intention is to share what I learn with those who want to learn these topics.
